### Overview

The SAT and ACT are standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.

The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). The ACT has 4 sections: English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science, with an additional optional writing section ([*source*](https://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/scores/understanding-your-scores.html)). They have different score ranges, which you can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for each test):
* [SAT](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat)
* [ACT](https://www.act.org/content/act/en.html)

Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry.

### Problem Statement

The participation rate for the state of California for ACT is significantly lower than SAT for year 2017 to 2019. This project aim to identify the relationship between the applicants, colleges and college major so that the schools in California will be able to advise high school students which test to take.

### Datasets

We will need to use the following datasets for analying the trend in participation rate for both SAT and ACT in the state of California:
* act_2017.csv (2017 ACT Scores by State)
* act_2018.csv (2018 ACT Scores by State)
* act_2019.csv (2019 ACT Scores by State)
* sat_2017.csv (2017 SAT Scores by State)
* sat_2018.csv (2018 SAT Scores by State)
* sat_2019.csv (2019 SAT Scores by State)
    
After understanding the trend, we can deep dive into the school in California and the number of test taker versus enrolled. We will be using:
* act_2019_ca.csv (2019 ACT Scores in California by School)
* sat_2019_ca.csv (2019 SAT Scores in California by School)
    
We will then use the test taker's score to identify which major and college will be have a higher success rate from taking SAT or ACT. We will be using:
* sat_2019_by_intended_college_major.csv (2019 SAT Scores by Intended College Major)
* sat_act_by_college.csv (Ranges of Accepted ACT & SAT Student Scores by Colleges)

### Conclusion and Recommendation

From our findings and analysis, we can deduce that the decrease in trend for state of California participation rate in ACT test might be due to the fact that the average composite of ACT test from state of California is 21.3 which then shows only 29 county out of 57 manange to secure more than average number of college. 

SAT test in 2019 show that the state of California did better in ERW rather than Math which effected the total benchmark percentage. Although this might be troubling, but we still see an upside in participation rate. This might be due to the fact that 28 out of 38 colleges majors accept students with lower ERW score, rather than Math. Thus they would have more option and higher chance of getting the major of their choice.

In order to be secure above average number of college, for ACT participant is it recommended to score at least 27.3 and for SAT test at least 1263. On top of the, if participant has a particular major in mind that has a lower benchmark for ERW, it is safe to say that the recommended test will be SAT Test.
